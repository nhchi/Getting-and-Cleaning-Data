Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

This is a repository for any and all code written for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

## Course Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

##Prepare source data:
There are 2 options to download the source data

###Option 1: 
* By running the download_data.R script.
###Option 2: 
* Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\R_Programing\UCI HAR Dataset\
* In RStudio: setwd("C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/R_Programing/UCI HAR Dataset")

##Instructions to run the R script



* Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\UCI HAR Dataset\

* In RStudio: setwd("C:\\\\Users\\\\yourname\\\\Documents\\\\R\\\\UCI HAR Dataset\\\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

* Use data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows. Note that the provided R script has no assumptions on numbers of records, only on locations of files.
